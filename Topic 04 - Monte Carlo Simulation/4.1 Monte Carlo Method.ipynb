    "## 4.1 Monte Carlo Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other mathematical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are quite useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures. Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in math, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to space and oil exploration problems, Monte Carloâ€“based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \"soft\" methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation."

    "Generating random numbers is inherently difficult. We generally can't create randomness on our own. If you asked the average student to draw 200 random dots on a rectangle, they'd end up much more evenly separated than the true random points.\n",
    "Adding to the difficulty with Monte Carlo techniques is the issue of trying to generate something random with computers, which are inherently nonrandom devices. There are physical sources of random numbers, such as the time between decay events in a radioactive sample, but it's hard to collect enough of these fast enough for what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally give up on truly random numbers, and use **Pseudo-Random** sequences of numbers instead. If the sequence of numbers meets the certain criteria, then they'll do the job even if they aren't technically random.\n",
